# NODEJS
## Application of C++ and Windows OS communication and CURL command line execution.
## to install a program (nodejs) and library (puppeteer) to the computer.

Contains the following libraries and function calls:
* iostream
* string
	* c_str
* curl

Contains the following external programs:
* npm

Contains the following files:
* main.cpp - System calls happen here to start another system program.
* nodejsinstall.bat - Where most system calls happen. Will research at another time
	if this is better than having it all as system call in c++

**Research currently points to systemcall in c++ being quicker to the .bat file.
	The reasoning behind this idea is the c++ compilers assembles a binary file 
	once where thru definition of a scripting language (ex. .bat, .js, etc.) 
	the .bat file needs interpretation.

Installs the following programs:
* nodejs-installer as nodejsbashinstall.msi
